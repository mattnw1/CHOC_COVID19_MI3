Elective surgical cases were canceled due to concern about hospital beds and the risk of perioperative COVID\u201019 infection. This same concern contributed to the dramatic decrease in non\u2010COVID\u201019 emergency cases presenting to the hospital which was associated with a dramatic increase in the at\u2010home deaths during this same period (reference is contact with FDNY regarding EMS at\u2010home death findings March\u2010April 2020). During this unprecedented time, a young woman with known Marfan syndrome (MFS) presented with an acute complicated type B aortic dissection (ACTBAD).",

On examination, her right leg was colder than the left one with no dopplerable distal pulses. Computed tomography scan showed Stanford type B aortic dissection from proximal descending aorta to the right common iliac artery (CIA), which was occluded. The true lumen (TL) was 95% compressed by a false lumen (FL) (Figure 1A,B). The celiac artery (CA), superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and left renal artery (RA) were perfused from FL. The flow to the right renal and CIA's was significantly decreased due to TL compression (Figure 1C,D). She was taken emergently to the operating room (OR). The procedure was performed under general anesthesia. Bilateral common femoral arteries were accessed percutaneously. An intravascular ultrasound examination was performed to confirm TL placement of the wires (Figure 2A,B). A 28 mm \u00d7 109 mm Zenith Alpha Thoracic Endovascular Graft (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) was deployed into the proximal descending aorta covering the primary tear site (Figure 2C). Significant compression of TL persisted (Figure 2D). Therefore, a 36 \u00d7 180 mm bare metal Zenith Dissection Endovascular Stent (Cook Medical) was placed down to the CA (Figure 2E). An aortogram confirmed antegrade filling of the CA, SMA, and right RA. The left RA was supplied from FL via distal fenestration (Figure 2F). The previously collapsed right CIA was fully re\u2010expanded and the right pedal pulses became palpable. The patient was extubated and transferred to the intensive care unit. The patient was stable overnight with no neurological deficits and a normal creatinine level. Due to the high risk of infection with COVID\u201019, she was discharged home 20 hours after surgery. Follow up was performed via frequent phone calls and she was seen in the office at 2 weeks.",
